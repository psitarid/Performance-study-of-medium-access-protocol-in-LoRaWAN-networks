# Performance study of medium access protocol in LoRaWAN networks



This thesis studies the operation of LoRaWAN networks and analyzes the general methodology behind the implementation of link-level simulations, according to the standards upheld by the relevant protocols and scientific literature. It begins with an introduction to IoT systems, and the challenges faced by this technological field. Then, the theoretical background of LoRaWAN networks is presented, starting with a broader perspective on network operations, emphasizing topology, layering, and security aspects. The paper continues analyzing the way information is structured across the different network layers, while also addressing constraints around useful parameters for implementing such simulations. A key part of the thesis is the simulation section, which serves as the practical component. A simulated LoRaWAN network is developed, with variable traffic congestion, and performance results are derived under different operating conditions, using specific metrics. At each stage, the methodology is explained for addressing issues arising during the simulation algorithmically. The final section presents the network performance results, evaluates the resulting behavior, and verifies the validity of the results by comparing them with those in the existing scientific literature.
