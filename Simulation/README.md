## Simulation

The network simulation of this thesis is developed in Python programming language in a form of an object-oriented project. 

• Gateway_Class.py: Defines the Gateway entity along with its attributes and its functions.

• Node_Class.py: Defines the Node entity along with its attributes and its functions.

• Simulation.py: Defines the Simulation entity along with its attributes and its functions.

• Tx_mode_functions.py: Contains functions used by every node when transmitting data.

• Rx_mode_functions.py: Contains functions used by every node when receiving data.
