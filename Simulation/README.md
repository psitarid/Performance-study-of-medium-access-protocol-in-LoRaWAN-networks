## Simulation
---

The network simulation presented in this thesis is developed in Python, following an object-oriented programming approach.

* **SF6.ipynb**: Initializes parameters, runs the simulation for SF6, and generates relevant graphs for network performance analysis.

* **SF12.ipynb**: Initializes parameters, runs the simulation for SF12, and generates relevant graphs for network performance analysis.

* **Gateway\_Class.py**: Defines the Gateway entity, including its attributes and methods.

* **Node\_Class.py**: Defines the Node entity, including its attributes and methods.

* **Simulation.py**: Defines the Simulation entity, including its attributes and methods.

* **Tx\_mode\_functions.py**: Contains functions related to node data transmission.

* **Rx\_mode\_functions.py**: Contains functions related to node data reception.

* **Time\_on\_Air\_Calculator.py**: Calculates the transmission duration of messages based on modulation parameters.
